# Symphony, a stack language.

This extension offers extensive syntax highlighting for the SYMPHONY stack language.

## Features

- Automatically highlights keywords such as function, label, goto, and more.
- Automatically highlights the variable names and function names such as `function main 0` and `label GO_HERE`
- Automatically highlights the logical and mathematical operators such as `and`, `le`, and `sub` 

## Requirements

This extension works best with the Visual Studio Dark+ theme (stylized as "Dark+ (default dark)" in the color theme selector), as the colors tend to meld together with other themes such that it's harder to distinguish the types from one another. You may stay with your current theme if you are comfortable with that though. 

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

Initial release of The Symphony stack language


**Enjoy the Extension!**
